Mobile.de Car Data Scraper is a responsible and ethical data scraping project that retrieves car listing data from [Mobile.de](https://www.mobile.de/). This project enforces delays between requests to avoid overloading the website's servers.

The project is written in Java 19 and makes use of the following technologies:
- Spring Boot
- Maven
- Log4j2
- JUnit 5
- Docker and Kubernetes

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following software installed on your machine:
- Java 19
- Docker and Kubernetes (optional, only if you want to deploy the project in a containerized environment)

### Running the application

1. Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/robertciotoiu/mobile-de-scraper.git
```

2. Set a valid [localPath](infrastructure/kubernetes/mobile-de-mongodb-configmap.yaml) to point to a location on your disk where the MongoDB will persist


3. Navigate to the project directory

```shell
cd mobile-de-car-data-collector/infrastructure
```

4. Build docker & push images and deploy all pods to a K8s namespace

```shell
./deploy.sh
```

Docker images will be built and pushed to the local docker image repository. Then it will create a namespace named "rc"(can be changed) and the K8s resources. 
Each pod will automatically start to crawl, parse and save car data listings into a MongoDB that runs in its own pod but persists the data locally on the disk.

### Running the tests

To run the JUnit tests, execute the following command in the project directory:

```mvn test```


## Deployment

If you want to deploy the project in a containerized environment, you can use Docker and Kubernetes.

## Built With

- Java 19
- Spring Boot
- Maven
- Log4j2
- JUnit 5
- Docker and Kubernetes
